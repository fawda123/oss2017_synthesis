* Vision to make it portable
* Why Bayesian networks
Benefits
=============

* A general and flexible framework that can be applied to unique locations and is not limited by data availability
* Explicit quantification of uncertainty and model updates with new data
* More focused restoration towards specific regional issues
* Improved ability to predict outcomes of proposed restoration projects
