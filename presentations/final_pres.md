* Vision to make it portable

Bayesian networks
========================================================
* Graphical modeling method based on influence diagrams.
* Represents the cause and effect dependencies of a process.
* Nodes are probability distributions and connectors are dependencies.
* Reasoning under uncertainty. 
* Used for decision making and artificial intelligence.
[Korb and Nicholson, 2004]


Benefits
=============

* A general and flexible framework that can be applied to unique locations and is not limited by data availability
* Explicit quantification of uncertainty and model updates with new data
* More focused restoration towards specific regional issues
* Improved ability to predict outcomes of proposed restoration projects
